## Cisco 8000 FIB Scale
# Introduction
Released 3 years ago in late 2019, Cisco 8000 routers have been widely adopted and deployed by service provider and cloud customers for core and peering roles.  

This article will document how Silicon One Q100 and Q200 based systems can support current and future BGP scale for peering and core roles. Based on projected growth, we will check they are future proof for the next years to come.  
Then, a new feature introduced to increase FIB scale on Q200 will also be demonstrated.
Telemetry data will also be used to illustrate system capabilities.

## Whatâ€™s The FIB Scale

## Cisco 8000 FIB Implementation

## FIB Scale Testing Methodology

## Current Resources utilization 
### Q100
### Q200

## Future BGP Growth Support

## 8000 FIB Scale Increase

## FIB Telemetry

## Conclusion

These tests assessed Cisco 8000 current and future FIB scale. Resources monitoring and visualization was done using both traditional CLI and streaming telemetry techniques. The new FIB scale increase, introduced with IOS-XR 7.9.1 and supported on Silicon One Q200, was also demonstrated. This ultimately confirms 8000 routers can deal with peering and core FIB profiles.
