## Introduction

On a Cisco 8800 router, Fan Tray (FT), Fabric Cards (FC) and Line Cards (LC) are Field Replaceable Units (FRU).  
8800 distributed systems use four Fan Trays but can operate with three fan trays while operator replaces one, or temporarily remove one to replace one of the Fabric Cards sitting behind the Fan Tray.  When a Fan Tray is removed, the remaining Fan Trays speed up their fans to maintain the designed airflow.  
Fabric Cards sit behind the Fan Trays on the chassis and the operator must remove Fan Tray unit to replace a Fabric card. 
This blog post details the steps required to replace a FT, FC and LC on a Cisco 8800 router. A video with detailed steps for FT and FC replacement is also linked in this post below and takes  8818 chassis as an example. At the time of publishing this video, the fabric card rail extension is only available on 8818 routers. All other steps are applicable to other chassis (8804, 8808, 8812).
