## Introduction
Released 3 years ago in late 2019, Cisco 8000 routers have been widely adopted and deployed by service provider and cloud customers for core and peering roles.  

This article will document how Silicon One Q100 and Q200 based systems can support current and future BGP scale for peering and core roles. Based on projected growth, we will check they are future proof for the next years to come.  
Then, a new feature introduced to increase FIB scale on Q200 will also be demonstrated.
Telemetry data will also be used to illustrate system capabilities.

## What’s The FIB Scale

Forwarding  Information Base was defined in [RFC1812](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1812#page-146). This is what Fred Baker wrote in 1995:

>
Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
        The table containing the information necessary to forward IP
        Datagrams, in this document, is called the Forwarding
        Information Base.  At minimum, this contains the interface
        identifier and next hop information for each reachable
        destination network prefix.

There is another old-school [RFC3222](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3222#section-5.5) defining the FIB scale aspect:

>
Forwarding Information Base Size
>
   Definition:
      Refers to the number of forwarding information base entries within
      a forwarding information base.
>
   Discussion:
      The number of entries within a forwarding information base is one
      of the key elements that may influence the forwarding performance
      of a router.  Generally, the more entries within the forwarding
      information base, the longer it could take to find the longest
      matching network prefix within the forwarding information base.

   Measurement units:
      Number of routes

20 years later, those points still matter when it comes to validate FIB scale on a modern router. Not only the number of prefixes is important, but it’s also key to consider prefixes distribution during validation. Ideally, a real FIB should be replayed and certification should not rely on artificial lab scenario (e.g: consecutive and well organized prefixes).  

Until now, Cisco 8000 officially supports up to 2M IPv4 and 500k IPv6 prefixes in FIB. This is a multi-dimensional number meaning both address families can be programmed to these maximum values. Introduced in March 2023, IOS-XR 7.9.1 brings FIB scale increase enhancement and raises this number to 3M IPv4 and 1M IPv6 prefixes. This new feature is covered later in this article.

**Did you know?:** A large-scale [study](https://storage.googleapis.com/site-media-prod/documents/20190610_Labovitz_Internet_Traffic_2009-2019_v1.pdf) realized in 2019 amongst 30 ISP and content providers revealed 95% of traffic was generated by less than 1000 BGP prefixes!

## Future BGP Growth Support

## 8000 FIB Scale Increase

## FIB Telemetry

## Conclusion

These tests assessed Cisco 8000 current and future FIB scale. Resources monitoring and visualization was done using both traditional CLI and streaming telemetry techniques. The new FIB scale increase, introduced with IOS-XR 7.9.1 and supported on Silicon One Q200, was also demonstrated. This ultimately confirms 8000 routers can deal with peering and core FIB profiles.
