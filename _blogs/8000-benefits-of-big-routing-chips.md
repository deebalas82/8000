# Introduction

High bandwidth routing ASICs deliver leading efficiency by reducing the number of devices needed to build network capacity.  
This video will explain why size matters and how it can affect networking systems space, power, cost and interconnects. Different design options will be explored (back to back, triangle or mesh, distributed chassis). Last, it will explain why power efficiency metrics such Watt per Gbps needs additional context for comparison.
