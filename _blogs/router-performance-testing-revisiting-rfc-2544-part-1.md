# Introduction

RFC 2544 has been there for a while and has been the main technique used to benchmark router's performance.
This first video introduces RFC 2544 methodology. It then covers the gaps between this lab measurement and the production networks reality. Last, factors determining ASICs packets-per-second are discussed.
