# Introduction

RFC 2544 was published in 1999 and has been the main technique used to benchmark router's performance.
This first video introduces RFC 2544 methodology. It then covers the gaps between this lab measurement and the production networks reality. Last, factors determining ASICs packets-per-second and new modern high end routers requirements are discussed.
