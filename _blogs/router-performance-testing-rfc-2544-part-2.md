excerpt: >-
  This second article about RFC 2544 explores performance in high performance
  ASICs. It introduces the concept of sawtooth and speedup. It also explains why
  performance can degrade for certain fixed packet sizes. Last, it also analyzes
  the different tradeoffs chip designers have to solve.

# Introduction

RFC 2544 was published in 1999 and has been the main technique used to benchmark router's performance.  
This second video explores performance in high performance ASICs. It introduces the concept of sawtooth and speedup. It also explains why performance can vary for certain  packet sizes and how it's possible to build artifical pathological lab cases.
