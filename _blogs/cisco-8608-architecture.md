## Introduction
The Cisco 8608 series is a part of Ciscoâ€™s Centralized Architecture based chassis design. Centralized systems have redundant Route Processors (RP w/CPU), redundant Switch cards (SCs w/Cisco Silicon One Q200 NPU) and in-service replaceable modular port adapters (MPA). Unlike distributed architecture, the forwarding decisions on Centralized platforms are centrally performed at the RP/SC and runs Cisco IOS XR software.
